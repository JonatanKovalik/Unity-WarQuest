## 🎮 WarQuest – Tactical Open World Combat Game

**WarQuest** is a professional, long-term Unity-based game development project built by a solo developer (age 14), aiming to create a feature-rich, single-player open-world war and adventure game. This repository is the main development space used for managing the game editor files, versioning, and updates.

> ⚠️ This repo does **not** contain the final game build – only the Unity editor project and development versions. Once the game is complete, a separate GitHub repository will be created for the final game code and binaries.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

* Manage the full development lifecycle of the **WarQuest** Unity game
* Track Unity editor versions, scenes, scripts, and assets
* Provide documentation and version control during development
* Be the primary workbench for testing, iteration, and integration

This is a serious project designed to showcase professional game development using Unity, C#, and external AI-powered tools for 3D assets and animation (documented separately).
